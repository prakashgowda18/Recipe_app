# Recipe_app
This guide details the creation of a Recipe App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the MealDB API. Users can search for recipes, view dish images, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions in a modal. Ideal for developers with basic API knowledge,.

# Recipe App Development Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive guide on constructing a Recipe App utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is tailored for individuals with foundational proficiency in `fetch()` and API interactions. The project leverages the MealDB API, a robust and user-friendly resource offering extensive data on culinary recipes and meal information.

## Project Overview
This project entails the development of an interactive web application enabling users to search for recipes by dish name. Upon execution, the application will present the following elements:
- A visual representation of the dish (image)
- The dish's name
- The country of origin
- A comprehensive list of ingredients and their measurements
- An interactive button labeled ‘View Recipe’, which triggers a modal containing detailed cooking instructions

The modal functionality enhances user experience by providing seamless access to step-by-step preparation guidelines.

## Technologies Employed
- **HTML**: Establishes the structural foundation of the application.
- **CSS**: Provides aesthetic enhancements and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements dynamic behavior and API data integration.
- **MealDB API**: Serves as the data source for meal and recipe information.

## Core Features
- **Search Functionality**: A user interface consisting of an input field and a search button for querying recipes.
- **Meal Display**: Visual output including an image, dish name, and its country of origin.
- **Ingredients Overview**: A detailed and structured list of ingredients with precise measurements.
- **Recipe Modal**: A pop-up window activated by the ‘View Recipe’ button, showcasing comprehensive cooking instructions.

## User Guide
1. Enter the name of the desired dish into the search input field.
2. Click on the ‘Search’ button to initiate the query.
3. The application will retrieve and display relevant data from the MealDB API, including an image, dish name, and country of origin.
4. Review the detailed ingredient list provided alongside the meal.
5. To access the complete cooking instructions, click the ‘View Recipe’ button, which will open a modal with step-by-step guidance.

## Installation and Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prakashgowda18/recipe-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd recipe-app
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to run the application.

## API Integration
This project incorporates the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). Below is an example of how to retrieve meal data using `fetch()`:
```javascript
fetch(`https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=${dishName}`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Process and render the meal data here
  });
```

## Customization Options
Developers are encouraged to personalize the application’s design by modifying the `style.css` file and extending functionality through JavaScript enhancements. This could include features such as user ratings, saving favorite recipes, or adding search filters.

## Conclusion
Engaging with this project offers a practical approach to mastering third-party API integration and enhancing the development of interactive web applications. The project emphasizes the effective use of fetch requests, JSON data handling, and dynamic manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM).
